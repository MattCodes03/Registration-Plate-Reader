# Registration-Plate-Reader
Detect Registration plate using Python OpenCV and Tesseract for Object Character Recognition (OCR)

This project is based on [this Tutorial.](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/license-plate-detection-and-recognition-using-opencv-and-pytesseract)

Tesseract must be installed and path must be updated at the following line, if running on your own machine.
```
pyt.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = 'Tesseract/tesseract.exe'
```
